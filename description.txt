This also will grant achievements.
Future plans:
1) Add a mod config to disable achievements being granted

4) Disabling this mod may lead to unexpected behaviour when it comes time for the game to close. 
	a) If this mod is disabled while closing the game and has been loaded previously, please make sure to check out Task Manager (or equivalent) to end the .net host process that is used by this modification.
